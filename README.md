Every season an enormous amount of data is produced in team sports like volleyball, handball, basketball and many others.
Studying this data by analyzing it, creating statistics and playlists of specific situations are important tools to reach the best possible results and lead the team to victory. To do so, different software is used.
Unfortunately a lot of data collected is never made public and every coach has his one little private storage of data on his computer or hard disk.

The main objectives of this project are to give a new life cycle to all the sports data collected, by saving it on a cloud, making it available to developers via API and creating the best possible interactive data visualization. 
Sports is an important part of the human culture, data should be valued, collected  and everybody should have access to the data of sports matches and statistics even in the far future..
VANDA has been thought out for exactly this reason. Sports data collected by standard sports software is saved on VANDA's database and visualized in an easy and interactive way for everyone.
