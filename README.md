# VANDA

Every season an enormous amount of data is produced in team sports like volleyball, handball, basketball and many others.
Studying this data by analyzing it, creating statistics and playlists of specific situations are important tools to reach the best possible results and lead the team to victory. To do so, different software is used.
Unfortunately a lot of data collected is never made public and every coach has his one little private storage of data on his computer or hard disk.

The main objective of VANDA is to give a new life cycle to all the sports data collected, by saving it on a cloud, making it available to developers via API and creating the best possible interactive data visualization. 
Sports is an important part of the human culture, data should be valued, collected  and everybody should have access to the data of sports matches and statistics even in the far far future..
VANDA has been thought out for exactly this reason. Sports data collected by standard sports software is saved on VANDA's database and visualized in an easy and interactive way for everyone.

VANDA means Visualization AND Analysis (and it was the name of my lovely aunt in Italy).
VANDA is written in P5.js, following the online youtube lessons of the great Daniel Shiffman (https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman).
VANDA started with volleyball but it's meant to improve the visualization of any other sport's data.
VANDA needs people and ideas to grow up.
